# Dotfiles Overview

The `dotfiles` directory holds configuration files for all components of the desktop. They are intended to be managed with `stow` so the structure mirrors `~/.config`.

## Fish shell

`config.fish` loads theme variables from `~/.cache/theme/colors.env`. Additional snippets in `conf.d/` provide the prompt and helper functions.

## Dunst

`dunstrc` includes `~/.cache/theme/dunst.conf` for colors generated by `apply_colors.sh` and defines notification timeouts.

## Fuzzel

The launcher configuration sets font, width and prompt options under `[main]`.

## Hyprland

- `hyprland.conf` contains global compositor settings and includes keybindings and autostart scripts.
- `bindings/keys.conf` lists keybindings.
- `autostart/start.sh` starts services like `swww`, `dunst` and `waybar`.

## Kitty

`kitty.conf` pulls in colors from `~/.cache/theme/kitty.conf` and tweaks window behaviour.

## Waybar

A JSON configuration and accompanying `style.css` control the status bar. `colors.css` is kept in sync with the generated theme by `apply_colors.sh`.
